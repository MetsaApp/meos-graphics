## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic ./internal/...

# View coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# Check coverage percentages
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total
```

## Future Improvements

While we've achieved excellent coverage, some areas could benefit from additional testing:

1. **Integration Tests**: Test the full request/response cycle
2. **Simulation Package**: Add tests for the simulation mode
3. **Logger Package**: Add tests for logging functionality
4. **Middleware Package**: Add tests for request logging middleware
5. **Error Cases**: More edge cases for network failures, timeouts, etc.
